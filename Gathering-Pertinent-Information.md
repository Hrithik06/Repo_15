Applications of robotics are found in various fields like medical, engineering, inspection, automation and military. Domain-based robots have various objectives and tasks to perform. For example, military based robots are designed to perform critical tasks on or off the battlefield. Military men used to use ropes to move from one mountain terrain to another carrying payload with them. This was dangerous as well as difficult to travel for longer distances. A robot was developed to solve this problem which has four wheels [1]. The wheels have to be fixed to a rope which allows the robot to move on it.
